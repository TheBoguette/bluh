# Information

Name: Mitranian
Appearance: Mitranians are pale red-skinned Humanoid creatures accompanied by fluffy tails. Their hair and tail colors can range from a deep marine blue to a glowing white. They possess considerable strength despite their small stature. Their horns can range from charcoal colored to a smokey gray. They also usually go backwards or loop around to the front.

Blunt Horns: You have a chance to deal 1d4 of Bludgeoning damage every time you attack if you land 1d20 with a DC of 15. When you have dealt Bludgeoning damage with your Horns, it is on cooldown for 4 turns.

Not Made For This: Since magic casters of your race have been hunted to near extinction, your knowledge of magic has been considerably lowered. You have a disadvantage of -2 on every roll with a magic item. And in addition, you cannot cast spells. However, potions or any alchemy items are not affected by this.

## Curse of Apotheos Variant

The curse of apotheos is a rare genetic mutation that allows you to perform magic, thus all the effects of the "Not Made For This" modifier have been completely negated. 
HOWEVER, this mutation makes your horns brittle, thus, you aren't able to attack with them.

Because of the scar like pattern on your body caused by the mutation, your charisma is decreased by -2 and your bones are a little less stronger than your fellow Mitranians, reducing the strength increase to +1.
